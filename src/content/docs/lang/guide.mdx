The programming language is currently under fairly heavy experimentation. It runs in
JavaScript on Bun or on the web via a translator program.

That program lives in the [lang](https://github.com/upvalue/otium) directory of the source
repository. The easiest way to use it is via the [web demo](/demos/lang/) which lets you
run code under the browser. 

Currently, there's enough functionality that [basic graphical demos with Raylib
work](https://github.com/upvalue/otium/blob/main/lang/examples/raylib-ball.ot), but still
missing major basic functionality like collections.
