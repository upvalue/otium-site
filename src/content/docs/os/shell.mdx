title: Tcl shell reference
---

Currently, the primary program under the operating system is a shell that supports a
very small subset of the [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) programming language,
with extensions to support operating system specific calls.

Once booted into the shell, you can write any arbitrary Tcl, though the shell currently
only supports parsing a single line of input at a time . For example

```tcl
proc plus {x y} {[+ x y]}
```

is valid command line input, whereas

```tcl
proc plus {x y} {
    [+ x y]
}
```

will cause an error.

The Tcl implementation is ultimately derived from
[picol](http://oldblog.antirez.com/page/picol.html) which is also a good document to read,
and there's an article that goes into the workings of the Tcl interpreter
[here](https://upvalue.io/posts/trialing-zig-and-rust-by-writing-a-tcl-interpreter/).

# Builtin commands

## Core

### Arithmetic and comparison

The arithmetic commands `+ - / * >= <= = < > !=` are all supported. They are all binary,
and there is no support for infix syntax (`expr`) at the moment.
