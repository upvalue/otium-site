The best place to use the operating system is the [web demo](/demo). When running the web
demo, the "recipes" dropdown allows entering some fun commands in the terminal and
executing them. It can be re-run using the buttons on the UI or by refreshing the page if
you get into trouble.

# Using the shell

Otium's shell is a subset of the [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) programming
language.

All commands can be printed out by entering `help` and command names can be searched through
using `help <name>`, ex `help fs/` to get help on all filesystem related commands.

`run` can be used to run built in C++-compiled programs

For example

`run echo hello world` echos hello world. 

`shutdown` shuts the operating system down (if using the web demo).

`dofile` can be used to execute Tcl programs created using the editor or filesystem commands.

For example,

> fs/write hello.tcl "puts \"hello world\""

> dofile hello.tcl

Will print hello world.

# Using graphical applications

Graphical applications can be quit with `Alt-Q`. Multiple graphical applications can be
navigated between using `Alt-<number>`.

# Using the editor

There is a built in graphical editor which supports a very small subset of Vim/emacs
keybindings.

Use `Alt-X` to enter commands.

The command mode (which can be triggered with M-x or the key `;` when in vim mode) evaluates
Tcl strings. The built in commands are:

`w` for write
`q` for quit
`togglemode` to toggle vim mode on and off
