**Otium** is a project to make a little computer and programming environment from scratch. It's...

An **operating system**. Inspired by Lisp machines, Smalltalk (particularly the moment where [Dan Ingalls redefines core system behavior](https://www.aneddoticamagazine.com/alto-system-project-dan-ingalls-demonstrates-smalltalk/) while giving a demo for Steve Jobs) and microkernels, the idea is to have a system that can be altered on the fly.

A **programming language**. Inspired by Scheme, Lua and with a little sugar to give it a C-like syntax. Based on a few of my past projects: [odd](https://github.com/upvalue/odd), [arete](https://github.com/upvalue/arete).

A **physical device** based on the [RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/) microcontroller. Targeting the [Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200) to start, it'll eventually have its circuit board, 3d printed case and of course a mechanical keyboard.

And it's also just getting started right now, but you can follow along on [github](https://github.com/upvalue/otium). There's the beginnings of some prototypes that will eventually converge.

With apologies.
