Otium is a little operating system project that I worked on from September to December of 2025.

It's a simple microkernel that runs on RISC-V (under QEMU) or on WebAssembly.

[Try the interactive demo →](/demo)

## Features

- The shell is a small implementation of [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) so normal programming works
- Graphics, filesystems and input devices support are just processes, which can crash normally without impacting the overall system
- A cooperative scheduler, which is implemented using Emscripten fibers on WebAssembly

## Screenshots
